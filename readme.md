# My Pocket Monsters

## What is this website?
My Pocket Monsters is a website based around tracking your current pokemon teams from your game. The idea is that as you collect pokemon and update your team in the game you can track the information in the website as well. This allows you to keep track of pokemon that may be stored on a PC in the game. Although the starters come from the Blue version, you can still add more recent starters later.

---------------

The purpose of this website is to store information about the user's current pokemon team. The user can choose a starter pokemon from the Blue version, or move on to the 'Pokemon' page to add other pokemon. From there they can add the rest of their team. On each information block there is a details button, which leads them to a page with further information including the pokemon's current moves. From this page they can move to the edit page and make any necessary changes including adding a nickname, or changing the level. They can also add and delete moves the pokemon knows on this page. The information block also has a delete button, if the pokemon is no longer being used, and a star which lets the user know which pokemon are currently on their team and not stored. 

## Next Steps:
- Add evolutions
- Allows players to see other players teams.
